AWS Amplify Library for React Native
####################################


.. meta::
    :description:
        Use React Native to create, build, test and monitor mobile apps that are
        integrated with AWS services.

`AWS Amplify <https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify>`_ is an open source JavaScript library for frontend and mobile developers building cloud-enabled applications. The library is a declarative interface across different categories of operations in order to make common tasks easier to add into your application. The default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources but is designed to be open and pluggable for usage with other cloud services that wish to provide an implementation or custom backends.

The AWS Mobile CLI, built on AWS Mobile Hub, provides a command line interface for frontend JavaScript developers to seamlessly enable and configure AWS services into their apps. With minimal configuration, you can start using all of the functionality provided by the AWS Mobile Hub from your favorite terminal application.
