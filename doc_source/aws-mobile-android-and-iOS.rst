        Use JavaScript to create, build, test and monitor mobile apps that are
        integrated with AWS services.

The AWS Mobile SDKs for Android and iOS, in combination with the `AWS Mobile Hub <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home>`_, allow you to quickly and easily integrate robust cloud backends into your existing mobile apps. No AWS expertise is required to configure and begin to use features like user sign-in, database, push notifications and more.
