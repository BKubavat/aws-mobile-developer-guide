##############################
Add Analytics to the Notes App
##############################

In the :ref:`previous section <tutorial-react-native-aws-mobile-notes-setup>` of this tutorial, we installed Android and/or iOS requirements, downloaded the tutorial note-taking app from GitHub, and then compiled and ran it in the Android Emulator and/or iOS Simulator. This tutorial assumes you have completed the those steps. In this section, we will extend the notes app to include application analytics. Application analytics allow us to gather demographic and behavioral information about the application usage.

You should be able to complete this section in 10-15 minutes.

Create and Connect to Your Backend
----------------------------------

To start, set up the mobile backend resources in AWS:

#. In a terminal, run:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd YOUR-APP-ROOT
       awsmobile init

   Type :userinput:`return` for each of the questions asked by the CLI.

#. Add the AWS Amplify library to your project:

   .. code-block:: bash

      yarn add aws-amplify-react-native
      react-native link amazon-cognito-identity-js

#. Add the following to the bottom of your :code:`import` list in :file:`App.js`.

   .. code-block:: bash

      import Amplify from 'aws-amplify-react-native';
      import awsconfig from './src/aws-exports';

      Amplify.configure(awsconfig);

.. list-table::

   * - **Used in this section**

     - `AWS Mobile Hub <https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home/>`_: Behind the scenes, configure your mobile app's AWS backend in minutes, and then to manage those resources as your app evolves.

       `AWS Amplify library <https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify>`_: Link your JavaScript to the AWS features you configure for your app, using this open source code.

Run the app and validate results
------------------------------------

   * - **Used in this section**

     - `Amazon Pinpoint <https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/>`_ service, which enacts your analytics.

#. Run the application using :code:`yarn run ios` or :code:`yarn run android`.

   Try creating, editing and deleting notes. Closing and reopening the app.

#. Run :code:`awsmobile console` in the terminal to view your project in the AWS Mobile Hub console.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Analytics` on the top right to open your project in the Amazon Pinpoint console.
#. Choose the :guilabel:`Analytics` icon on the left. You should see an up-tick in several graphs:

   .. only:: pdf

      .. image:: images/pinpoint-overview.png
         :scale: 50

   .. only:: kindle

      .. image:: images/pinpoint-overview.png
         :scale: 75


#. Choose :guilabel:`Demographics` to view the demographics information.

   .. image:: images/pinpoint-demographics.png
      :scale: 100 %
      :alt: Image of the Amazon Pinpoint console Demographics tab.

   .. only:: kindle

         :scale: 75

If you see data within each page, you have successfully added analytics
to your app. Should you release your app, you can come
back here to see more details about your users.

Add Custom Analytics
--------------------

Amazon Pinpoint enables you to capture data for custom events specific to your app. Use the following steps to insert :code:`addNote` and :code:`deleteNote` metrics into your app analytics.

#. Add the following import to :file:`NoteListScreen.js`.

    .. code-block:: javascript

       import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify-react-native';

*. Add the following call to :code:`Analytics.record` in the :code:`onAddNote()` method, to gather metrics each time a note is created.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        static onAddNote(navigate) {
            navigate('details', { noteId: uuid.v4() });

            // Send a saveNote event to Amazon Pinpoint
            Analytics.record('SaveNote');

        }

*. Add the following call to :code:`Analytics.record` in the :code:`onDeleteNote()` event handler, to gather metrics each time a note is deleted`.

    .. code-block:: javascript

        onDeleteNote(item) {
            this.props.deleteNote(item.noteId);

            // Send a deleteNote event to Amazon Pinpoint
            Analytics.record('DeleteNote');

        }

Run and Validate Custom Analytics

Run and exercise your app by adding and deleting notes, unloading and reloading your app. Then, in the Amazon Pinpoint console for your app:

#. Choose :guilabel:`Events`.

#. Use the Event drop down to show only the :guilabel:`AddNote` event.

   .. image:: images/pinpoint-addnote.png
      :scale: 100 %
      :alt: Image of the Add note event in the Amazon Pinpoint.

   .. only:: pdf

      .. image:: images/pinpoint-addnote.png
         :scale: 50

   .. only:: kindle

      .. image:: images/pinpoint-addnote.png
         :scale: 75

New events my take a few minutes to show up in the console. Then you should see :guilabel: `addNote and :guilabel:`deletNote` in the event list dropdown and events counted in the graphs displayed.
