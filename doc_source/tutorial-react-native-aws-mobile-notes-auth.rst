###################################
Add Authentication to the Notes App
###################################

In the :ref:`previous section <tutorial-android-aws-mobile-notes-analytics>` of this tutorial, we created a mobile backend project in AWS Mobile Hub, installed AWS Amplify, and then added analytics to the sample note-taking app. This section assumes you have completed those steps. If you jumped to this step, please go back and :ref:`start from
the beginning <tutorial-android-aws-mobile-notes-setup>`. In this tutorial, we will configure a sign-up / sign-in flow in our mobile backend. We will then add a new authentication activity to our note-taking app.

You should be able to complete this section of the tutorial in 20-30 minutes.

Add User Sign-in to the AWS Mobile Hub project
----------------------------------------------

Before we work on the client-side code, we need to add User Sign-in to
the backend project:

#. Run :code:`awsmobile console` to open your project in the |AMH| console.
#. Scroll down until you see :guilabel:`Add More Backend Features`.
#. Choose the :guilabel:`User Sign-in` tile.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Email and Password`.
#. Scroll to the bottom of the page, then Choose :guilabel:`Create user pool`.


Add User Analytics
------------------

   * - **Used in this section**

     - `Amazon Cognito <https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/>`_ service, which provides user credentials and provides identity authentication from AWS and in federation with Facebook, Google and other identity providers.

#. In the |AMH| console, choose :guilabel:`Resources` on the top right.
#. Choose the :guilabel:`Amazon Cognito User Pools` entry to open the Amazon Cognito console.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Analytics` on the left and then choose :guilabel:`Add analytics and campaigns`.
#. Fill in the form:

   * :guilabel:`Amazon Cognito app client`: Select the non-web version for your app.
   * :guilabel:`Amazon Pinpoint project`: Select your project.
   * :guilabel:`Share user profile data with Amazon Pinpoint`: Ensure this is checked.
   * :guilabel:`IAM role`: Type :userinput:`YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-Cognito-Pinpoint-Integration`, and then click :guilabel:`Create Role`.

Update Your Client AWS Configuration
------------------------------------

#. Update your app's configuration file by running the following command from your app root.

   .. code-block:: bash

      awsmobile pull

#. In your app's :file:`App.js` file:

   #. edit the import for :code:`aws-amplify-react-native` to the following.

       .. code-block:: bash

          import Amplify, { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react-native';

   #. Adjust the last line of the file to use withAuthenticator() as follows.

      .. code-block:: bash

         export default withAuthenticator(App);

Run the app and validate results
------------------------------------

#. Run the application using :code:`yarn run ios` or :code:`yarn run android`.

   The app prompts you to sign up or sign in. Go through the sign-up process. Note that youâ€™ll receive a validation code as either an email or SMS text message. Then sign in with your newly created credentials.

   Choose the :guilabel:`Create new account` button to create a new account. Once the information is submitted, you will be sent a confirmation code via email. Enter the confirmation code to complete registration, then sign-in with your new account.

       * - **Tip**

         - Use Amazon WorkMail as a test email account

           If you do not want to use your own email account as a test account, create an
           `Amazon WorkMail <https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/>`_ service within AWS for test accounts. You can get started for free with a 30-day trial for up to 25 accounts.
